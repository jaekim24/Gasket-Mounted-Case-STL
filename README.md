# Gasket-Mounted-Case-STL

[UPDATE]
I noticed there are some people interested in this so I will start working on it soon.
Not done yet still in the prototyping stage. Been occupied with school. 


Used Fusion 360 to design a gasket mounted keyboard case. It is a 60 percent keyboard. The gasket mountable plate is from KBDfans, PCB is DZ 60 also from KBDfans.  *****dont forget to put the links in the description****
